### Comment & Feedback

>This second essay, like the first, seeks to explain the reason for a delayed project submission and to request an extension. Here's an assessment based on the same IELTS Writing assessment criteria:
>
>### Task Achievement
>The essay addresses the three main tasks: introducing yourself, explaining why the project wasn't submitted on time, and requesting more time. However, the reasons for the delay and the details of the extension request could be more clearly articulated and detailed. **Estimated Band: 6**
>
>### Coherence and Cohesion
>The essay generally follows a logical order, but the flow of information and the coherence between ideas could be improved. Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, which disrupts the smooth progression of ideas. Better paragraphing and clearer connections between sentences would enhance coherence. **Estimated Band: 5-6**
>
>### Lexical Resource
>There's an attempt to use a range of vocabulary relevant to the situation, but there are several errors in word choice and usage ("enroll" instead of "enrolled," "felt asleep" instead of "fell asleep," "litter better" instead of "little better"). These errors sometimes hinder clear communication. **Estimated Band: 6**
>
>### Grammatical Range and Accuracy
>The essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including tense inconsistencies, incorrect verb forms ("felt asleep"), and missing articles ("the" doctor, "the" deadline). These errors impact the clarity and accuracy of the writing. More attention to grammatical accuracy is needed. **Estimated Band: 5-6**
>
>### Suggestions for Improvement
>- **Clarify and Expand Your Explanation**: Provide a clearer and more detailed explanation of the circumstances that led to the delay, including how you managed your time and what steps you've taken to progress with your work.
>- **Improve Grammar and Vocabulary**: Focus on improving grammatical accuracy and expanding your vocabulary. Pay attention to verb tenses, article usage, and correct phrasing for more natural English expression.
>- **Enhance Coherence**: Work on the flow of your essay by connecting ideas more smoothly and using transitional phrases where necessary.
>
>### Overall Estimated Band Score
>Considering the assessment across all four criteria, this essay would likely achieve an **overall band score of 6**. To improve your score, focus on enhancing the clarity and detail of your explanations, using a wider range of vocabulary accurately, and improving your grammatical range and accuracy. These steps will help in making your writing more coherent and effectively communicating your message.
